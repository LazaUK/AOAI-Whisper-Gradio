# Jump-start Python templates to demo Whisper in the Gradio-powered Web apps
Whisper models allow you to transcribe and translate audio files (speech to text). In this repo I'll demo how to utilise them offline or consume from Azure endpoints. Each option from the table of contents below is wrapped into a functional Web interface, powered by [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) platform.

## Table of contents:
- [Option 1 - Access to Whisper models in offline mode](https://github.com/LazaUK/AOAI-Whisper-Gradio/blob/main/README.md#option-1---access-to-whisper-models-in-offline-mode)
- [Option 2 - Access to Whisper models via Azure OpenAI endpoint](https://github.com/LazaUK/IndustrySolutions-WindFarm#step-2---setup-azure-iot-hub)
- [Option 2 - Access to Whisper models via Azure AI Speech endpoint](https://github.com/LazaUK/IndustrySolutions-WindFarm#step-3---deploy-azure-function)
